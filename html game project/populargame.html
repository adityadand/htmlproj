&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the game's;map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on February 4, 2019, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without any prior announcement or marketing.
The gameplay of Apex fuses elements from a variety of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video games, including Respawn's own Titanfall series, battle royale games, class-based shooters, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those with evolving narratives. Approximately sixty players are pitted against each other on an island in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squads of three, with one player controlling where their squad lands. The squads then must scavenge for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons and other resources to fight other squads, during which the play area gradually constricts in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size until one squad remains, thus ending the match.The concept for the game came to fruition during the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development of a new Titanfall game, after EA's acquisition of Respawn in 2017. The sudden success of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle royale genre prompted the developers to create one of their own that incorporates elements of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;series, in addition to the concepts seen in games throughout the past decade. Following its release, the developers announced plans for cross-platform play, as well as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ports for iOS, Android, and the Nintendo Switch, in the future.
